* Maps
  * Collections of value types that are accessed via keys
  * Created via literals or via make function
  * Members accessed via[key] syntax
    * myMap["key"] = "value"
  * Check for presense with "value, ok" form of result
  * Multiple assignments refer to same underlying data
* Structs
  * Collections of disparate data types that describe a single concept
  * Keyed by named fields
  * Normally created as types, but anonymous structs are allowed
  * No inhertance, but can use composition via embedding
  * Tags can be added to struct fields to describe field
