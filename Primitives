* Boolean type
  * Values are true or false
  * Not an alias for other types(e.g. int)
  * Zero value is false

* Numeric types
  * Integers
    * Signed Integers
      * int type has varying size but min 32 bits
      * 8 bit(int8) through 64 bit(int64)
    * Unsigned integers
      * 8 bit(byte and uint8) through 32 bit(uint32)
    * Arithmetic operations
      * Additions, sub, mul, div, remainder
    * Bitwise operations
      * And, or, xor, and not
    * Zero value is 0
    * Can't mix types in same family(uint16 + uint32 = error)
  * Floating point numbers
    * Follow IEEE-754 standard
    * Zero value is 0
    * 32 and 64 bit versions
    * Literal styles
      * Decimal(3.14)
      * Exponential(13e18 oe 2E10)
      * Mixed(13.7e12)
    * Arithmetic operations
      * Addition, sub, mul, div
  * Complex numbers
    * Zero value is (0+0i)
    * 64 and 128 bit versions
    * Built-in functions
      * complex - make complex number from two floats
      * real - get real as float
      * imag - get imaginary part as float.
    * Arithmetic operations
      * Additions, sub, multi, division
      
* Text Types
  * Strings
    * UTF-8
    * Immutable
    * Can be concatenated with play(+) operator
    * Can be converted to []byte
  * Rune
    * UTF-32
    * Alias for int32
    * Special methods normally required to process
      * strings.Reader#ReadRune
