* Immutable, but can be shadowed
* Replaced by the compiler at compile time
  * value must be calculable at compile time
* Named like variables
  * PascalCase for exported constants
  * camelCase for internal constants
* Typed constants work like immutable variables
  * Can interoperate only with same type
* Untyped constants work like literal
  * Can interoperate with similar types
* Enumerated constants
  * Special symbol iota allows related constants to be created easily
  * Iota starts at 0 in each const block and incremnets by one
  * Watch out of constant values that match zero values for variables
* Enumberated expressions
  * Operations that can be determined at compile time are allowed 
    * Arithmetic
    * Bitwise operations
    * Bitshifting
